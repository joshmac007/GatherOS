// First-run walkthrough steps. Each step renders the same tooltip
// shell — what differs is the target (if any) and how it advances.
// Step targets are CSS selectors resolved at render time against
// the live DOM; target: null means no spotlight (the tooltip is
// pinned bottom-left either way).
//
// Optional fields:
//   - noBack:       true to hide the Previous button on this step.
//                   Used when reverse navigation would land in a
//                   state the previous step doesn't expect.
//   - onEnter:      selector the overlay clicks on its own when
//                   the step becomes active (used to auto-navigate
//                   the user between modes without an extra Next).
//   - dimSiblings:  true to fade every card except the target,
//                   pulling the eye by contrast instead of a
//                   stroke ring. The fade is applied via a CSS
//                   rule on body[data-onboarding-dim="cards"] —
//                   ImageCard sets its own inline style so a JS-
//                   driven approach gets clobbered on re-render.
//
// Advance types:
//   - { type: 'next', label, clickBefore } explicit Next button.
//                                    clickBefore: a selector the
//                                    overlay clicks before
//                                    advancing (e.g. closing the
//                                    detail panel).
//   - { type: 'appears', selector }  waits for a selector to mount
//                                    (e.g. detail panel appearing).
//   - { type: 'choice', options }    branching final step. Each
//                                    option = { label, value,
//                                    action?, danger? } — action
//                                    is a string keyed in
//                                    OnboardingOverlay (currently
//                                    only 'remove-starter-pack').
